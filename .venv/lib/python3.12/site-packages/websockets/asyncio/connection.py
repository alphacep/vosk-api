          (:class:`bytes`, :class:`bytearray`, or :class:`memoryview`) in a

          using a JSON library that produces a bytestring.
        * Set ``text=False`` to send a string (:class:`str`) in a Binary_
          frame. This may be useful for servers that expect binary frames
          instead of text frames.

        :meth:`send` also accepts an iterable or asynchronous iterable of
        strings, bytestrings, or bytes-like objects to enable fragmentation_.
        Each item is treated as a message fragment and sent in its own frame.
        All items must be of the same type, or else :meth:`send` will raise a
        :exc:`TypeError` and the connection will be closed.

        .. _fragmentation: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6455#section-5.4

        :meth:`send` rejects dict-like objects because this is often an error.
        (If you really want to send the keys of a dict-like object as fragments,
        call its :meth:`~dict.keys` method and pass the result to :meth:`send`.)

        Canceling :meth:`send` is discouraged. Instead, you should close the
        connection with :meth:`close`. Indeed, there are only two situations
        where :meth:`send` may yield control to the event loop and then get
        canceled; in both cases, :meth:`close` has the same effect and the
        effect is more obvious:

        1. The write buffer is full. If you don't want to wait until enough
           data is sent, your only alternative is to close the connection.
           :meth:`close` will likely time out then abort the TCP connection.
        2. ``message`` is an asynchronous iterator that yields control.
           Stopping in the middle of a fragmented message will cause a
           protocol error and the connection will be closed.

        When the connection is closed, :meth:`send` raises
        :exc:`~websockets.exceptions.ConnectionClosed`. Specifically, it
        raises :exc:`~websockets.exceptions.ConnectionClosedOK` after a normal

    """
    Broadcast a message to several WebSocket connections.

    A string (:class:`str`) is sent as a Text_ frame. A bytestring or bytes-like
    object (:class:`bytes`, :class:`bytearray`, or :class:`memoryview`) is sent
    as a Binary_ frame.

    .. _Text: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6455#section-5.6
    .. _Binary: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6455#section-5.6

    You may override this behavior with the ``text`` argument:

    * Set ``text=True`` to send an UTF-8 bytestring or bytes-like object
      (:class:`bytes`, :class:`bytearray`, or :class:`memoryview`) in a
      Text_ frame. This improves performance when the message is already
      UTF-8 encoded, for example if the message contains JSON and you're
      using a JSON library that produces a bytestring.
    * Set ``text=False`` to send a string (:class:`str`) in a Binary_
      frame. This may be useful for servers that expect binary frames
      instead of text frames.

    :func:`broadcast` pushes the message synchronously to all connections even
    if their write buffers are overflowing. There's no backpressure.

    If you broadcast messages faster than a connection can handle them, messages
    will pile up in its write buffer until the connection times out. Keep
    ``ping_interval`` and ``ping_timeout`` low to prevent excessive memory usage
    from slow connections.

    Unlike :meth:`~websockets.asyncio.connection.Connection.send`,
    :func:`broadcast` doesn't support sending fragmented messages. Indeed,
    fragmentation is useful for sending large messages without buffering them in
    memory, while :func:`broadcast` buffers one copy per connection as fast as
    possible.

    :func:`broadcast` skips connections that aren't open in order to avoid
    errors on connections where the closing handshake is in progress.

    :func:`broadcast` ignores failures to write the message on some connections.
    It continues writing to other connections. You may set ``raise_exceptions``
    to :obj:`True` to record failures and raise all exceptions in a :pep:`654`
    :exc:`ExceptionGroup`.

    While :func:`broadcast` makes more sense for servers, it works identically
    with clients, if you have a use case for opening connections to many servers
    and broadcasting a message to them.
